# Comparing Python & Javascript Intro
# Chapter 2: More Fundamentals

In the previous chapter, we introduced the basics and fundamental concepts of both languages, such as variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.

In this chapter, more fundamentals will be introduced. Some of the concepts introduced won't get into much detail until later in the series. This chapter will serve an overview of the topics covered in detail throughout the series.

If you're new to either of the languages, take the time reviewing the concepts and code examples here in depth. Some concepts need to by reviewed multiple times to grasp.
