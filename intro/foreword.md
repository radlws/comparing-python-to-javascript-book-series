# Comparing Python & Javascript: Introduction
# Foreword

Ever come across a concept that is confusing to you or you just don't understand and maybe you start feeling like a fraud. You question your skills, abilities and past experience. Maybe you feel like you used to know a concept just barely on the surface and nights of pounding back 40s made you forget?

Well this series will try and fix just that. It will try and create a strong understanding that will not be washed away with a bit of binge drinking on the weekends!

No more feelings of intimidation, frustration or regret! Time to learn the fundamentals as efficiently as possible, based on your knowledge of one language you can learn another language quite quickly by drawing conclusions on how the two relate.

So the stronger you are at one language, the easier it will be to learn the other here with concrete examples and explanations of how the two relate. Not to say that an intermediate or a beginner in one language cannot learn just as efficiently, you just have to spend a bit more time repeating the concepts.

A day at the office, of just barely making this work just isn't enough for you, you've been there for too long and you always wanted to get out of copying and pasting code you may not fully understand.  You want to achieve mastery, reach an expert level at your craft! You always knew deep down that you're a perfections and getting your work done is just not enough. So get ready for the adventure, and really spend sometime on getting the core fundamentals right before moving on. Things will pick up later when all the small pieces are clear and you can start putting it all togeter.

Now for a moment of clarity, don't beat yourself up, get in there and prove to yourself that you're packing some serious skills.

Get out of your comfort zone and get ready for those "Whoa" moments that will make you feel more superior than Neo in the Matrix when he just learned Kung Fu.
