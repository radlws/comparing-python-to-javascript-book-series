# Comparing Python to Javascript
# Preface

You know Python or Javascript fairly well but you want to explore the internals of the language and how it differs from other languages. You have noticed the popularity of Python in the industry and you know that you can never count JavaScript out due to its popularity on the client side and more recently on the server side.

You have a deep desire to master both languages but don't know where to start and you want to eliminate any confusion between the two.

You are confident with Python or Javascript, but don't know where to start when learning one of these languages for the first time.

Maybe you don't know either language but are intrigued by both and you have a solid fundamental knowledge about programming based on another language.

This series will take the task of learning *all major parts* of both Python and JavaScript and is not intended as a quick start guide. It is not intended to compare which language is better or more efficient in any way as we all have to agree both languages are here to stay.

## Mission

This book will cover a lot of material with as little words as possible but enough to make distinctions clear.  Examples will be kept to a minimum but with just enough detail to get the point across.

Often times own research will be required to dive down into the deeper mechanisms of the respective languages.


## Summary

A comparison of the two of the most popular programming languages used in the software industry today based on a developers view. What to these languages share in common and what contrasts between them may cause confusion.
